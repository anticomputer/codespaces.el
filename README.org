#+TITLE: codespaces.el

This package provides support for connecting to [[https://github.com/features/codespaces][GitHub Codespaces]] in Emacs via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][TRAMP]].

You will need to have the GitHub [[https://cli.github.com][command line tools]] (~gh~) installed.

Here is an example ~use-package~ declaration (though it won't work until I stick this on MELPA):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package use-package-ensure-system-package
    :ensure t)
  (use-package codespaces
    :ensure-system-package gh
    :config
    (codespaces-setup)
    :bind
    ("C-c S" . #'codespaces-connect))
#+end_src

* Missing features

- Should ensure that ~gh codespace list~ works okay.
- Should warn when trying to connect to a non-started codespace, and if so then start the codespace out-of-band before entering TRAMP, as otherwise we hit timeouts.
- Completion should sort codespaces by most-recently-used.

* Credits

Thanks to [[https://github.com/anticomputer][Bas Alberts]] for writing the code to register ~ghcs~ as a valid TRAMP connection method.
